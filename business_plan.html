      <p>The STEM bot is a unique machine that helps you with sorting and cleaning up garbage in public places like in school a campus. <br>It is a helpful device that will help the environment and the workers that are working on the school campus. <br>One reason why STEM bot is unique is that there aren’t any other robots that has these abilities. <br>Another reason that STEM bot is unique is that it can work anytime. <br>The school can’t hire workers to clean up messes on weekends or other non-school times. <br> The STEM bot can work and clean up day or night.

      <h2 style="color:blue">Long Term Growth</h2>
      <p>In the next five years we hope to release a new STEM Bot that is cheaper than the product for schools. <br> In this STEM Bot we plan to make it smaller and slower running than the one for schools.<br> We will add more modes for houses with pets, toddlers, and elders like a double safety mode. <br>In the future run, we also plan to make to make different colors, like white, black and gray. <br>We also plan to make the battery life longer than 5 hours as of right now, to 13 hours, <br>so that it cleans more thoroughly and our customers right us great reviews.</p>

      <h4>SWOT: Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats</h4>
      <p>Strengths: An unique product which strengthens the environment by sorting up recyclable materials out of the trash.<br>
        Weaknesses: We have an expensive product, can be made cheaper by replacing components with cheaper parts. Our robot also seems a bit clunky, and it could have more improvements too.<br>
        Opportunities: We have a chances to create outreaches in the local community to promote our product and our company. We can show the community members what we do, and share our mission statement and goals.<br>
        Threats: Product can be messed around and damaged by students and workers around the campus which the product is stationed. The company could lose more money building the product than gaining money.Product can be messed around and damaged by students and workers around the campus which the product is stationed.
